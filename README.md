# An R project for numerical solution of the Kiefer-Weiss problem

The Kiefer-Weiss problem consists in finding a sequential hypothesis tests minimizing the maximum average sample size 
among all the tests whose error probabilities of the first and second kind do not exceed some prescribed levels.

This repository contains accompanying R program code for two articles:

[*Novikov, A., Novikov, A., Farkhshatov, F. A computational approach to  the Kiefer-Weiss problem for sampling from 
a Bernoulli population, 2021, arXiv.org preprint arXiv:2110.04802 [stat.ME]*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04802)

and

The accompanying code for the first one, covering sampling from a Bernoulli population is placed in [bernoulli](bernoulli) directory. 

The accompanying code for the second paper, covering sampling from binomial, Poisson and negative binomial (Pascal)
distributions is placed in [discrete](discrete) directory.
